# How-to-Predict-Stock-Prices-Easily-Demo
Based off of the Deep Learning #7 Course by Siraj Raval! Awesome Dude, check him out.

## Overview

Use an [LSTM neural network](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) to predict the closing price of the S&P 500 using a dataset of past prices. LSTM is great with regressive nets - LSTM - Long Short-Term Memory -- very cool.

## Dependencies

* keras
* tensorflow

Install Keras from [here](https://keras.io/) and Tensorflow from [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/get_started/os_setup). 

## Usage

My Code is [here](https://github.com/srfnmnk/play---tensorflow-deepLearning/blob/master/Tensorflow-Stock-Predictions/uniVariateStockPrediction.ipynb) but it's cloned and edited from [Siraj's Udacity Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101)

# Coding Challenge

Use the price history AND two other metrics of your choice to predict the price of GOOGL stock with an LSTM network. You can find the CSV [here](https://www.google.com/finance/historical?q=NASDAQ%3AGOOGL&ei=Xu6wWKnDAcS1jAGX6a-ACg). Metrics could be sentiment analysis from Twitter of what people have said about Google, dividends, etc.
